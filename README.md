# RESISTANCE-AND-CAPACITANCE-COMBINATION-CALCULATOR-IN-C

This is a *C program* that can calculate the equivalent resistance for series or parallel combination of capacitors and resistors.

I have tried to make this as dynamic as possible and have tried to take maximum user inputs using basic conditionals and arithmetic.

# WHAT CHANGES THIS MIGHT NEED :

1. Having a controlled loop that can repeat this
2. Utilisation of <math.h>
3. Better Code Formatting

In the end, I am always open for suggestion :)
